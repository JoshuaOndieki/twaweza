            <h1>Company Profile
            </h1>
            <p>We are a Kenyan company focused on promoting tourism in Kenya.
                Our aim is to ensure that we invest in advertising our country's rich heritage to the outside world.
                We are also ensuring that tourists visiting our country do not regret making the visit due to various reasons:
                <ul>
                    <li>Unneccesary spending of tourist's money for simple favours such as directions.
                    THis is a very common norm that people have adapted to rip off tourists.</li>
                    <li>Less fullfilment for tourists due to lack of knowledge of where one can visit.</li>
                    <li>Limits due to unplanned expenditures.</li>
                    <li>Time wasted finding tour guides.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h1>How it Works
            </h1>
            <p>
                Our business model is a simple one. All you need is to book for your vacation as a package.
